Console Hangman is a command-line based Hangman game developed as a fun and interactive word-guessing experience. In this game, the player will be challenged to guess a word within a certain number of attempts. The goal is to correctly guess all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is completely drawn.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection:** The computer randomly selects a word from a provided list for each game.
- **Scoring System:** Two scoring options - Simple Scoring and Complex Scoring - to measure player performance.
- **Dynamic Hangman Figure:** A graphical representation of the hangman figure that changes with each incorrect guess.
- **Project Structure:** Organized classes for better code structure and maintainability.

## How to Play

The computer will randomly select a word from a provided list. The word will be displayed as a series of dashes, representing each letter in the word. The player has six guesses to correctly guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess will result in a part of the hangman figure being drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman figure is completely drawn. To win, the player must guess all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is completed.
